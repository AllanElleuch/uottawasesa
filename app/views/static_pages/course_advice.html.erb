				<strong>CEG3185/CEG3585</strong><br><br>
				
				SEG and CSI students often find this course challenging due to the phyiscs and math in the course.
				Here is a <%= link_to 'list of tutorials','http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lpeyton/cegtutorials/', target: '_blank' %> that have been put together to help students.
				ALSO, this text book by Behrouz A. Forouzan is recommended. It is much easier to understand than the book by Stallings and has good practice questions.
