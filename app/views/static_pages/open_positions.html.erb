      </p>
      <p>
        We are a bunch of like-minded kids that are passionate about technology. We believe that each one of us can do their part in making the world a better place through software. We like to invest our time and energy in strengthening our uOttawa software community. We believe in applying software engineering principles to our daily life. We believe in iterative delivery rather than being afraid of failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use various cutting edge tools throughout our daily operations. We are always online. We support each other online. We plan online. We communicate online. We follow the practices and use the tools that you would at a real "tech." workplace. That requires a commitment from each and every member. <b>We expect you to use these tools.</b>
      </p>
      <p>

Not only do students from uOttawa Engineering view this website, but also other faculties, professors, and other clubs. Moreover, outside corporations and your future employeers will likely reference this website to checkup on you. Needless to say, this is a very critical role.
